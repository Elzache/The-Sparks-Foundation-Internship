# The-Sparks-Foundation-Internship
This repository consists of the tasks I completed during my internship under The Sparks Foundation

Task 1 (Prediction using Supervised ML)

In this regression task we will predict the percentage of marks that a student is expected to score based upon the number of hours they studied.
This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just two variables. Data can be found at http://bit.ly/w-data.
What will be predicted score if a student study for 9.25 hrs in a day? 

Task 2 (Prediction using Unsupervised ML)

From the given ‘Iris’ dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually.
Use R or Python or perform this task. Data can be found : https://bit.ly/3kXTdox

Task 3 (Exploratory Data Analysis - Retail)

Perform ‘Exploratory Data Analysis’ on dataset ‘SampleSuperstore’

As a business manager, try to find out the weak areas where you can work to make more profit.
What all business problems you can derive by exploring the data?
You can choose any of the tool of your choice (Python/R/Tableau/PowerBI/Excel/SAP/SAS). Data can be found: https://bit.ly/3i4rbWl
